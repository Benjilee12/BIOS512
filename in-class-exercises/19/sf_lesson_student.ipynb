    "### 1.4 What is Geospatial Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data refers to any data that is associated with a location on Earth (or another planet). Usually this means that the data has coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude or easting and northing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of geospatial data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. points - a single coordinate combination of x and y (or longitude and latitude, respectively)\n",
    "2. lines - 2 or more points form a line\n",
    "3. polygons - 2 or more lines form a polygon\n",

    "### 1.5 Two Major Types of Spatial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of geospatial data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. vector data - points, lines, polygons\n",
    "2. raster data - pixels (grid) where each grid cell represents a single attribute value\n",

    "### 1.6 The Tidyverse and Spatial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As of November 2019, there are two major spatial data R packages that interface well with the tidyverse. These are the sf and stars packages. We'll focus primarily on the sf package in this lesson because it works well with the tidyverse. I offer a number of links at the end of this document for you to learn more about other spatial data analysis packages for R.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6.1 sp (A Bit of History)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *sp* package is the first iteration of an R package created to handle vector spatial data. Given the likelihood that you'll come across old code, it's helpful to be familiar with both the older sp package and it's newer version, the sf package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Know About sp:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developed in 2005\n",
    "* Special objects of class SpatialData (an S4 datatype)\n",
    "* Composed of lists in lists (i.e., nested lists)\n",
    "* Attributes and spatial data are accessed using the @ symbol\n",
    "* Not always easy to manipulate the data because not the same as a regular data frame\n",
    "* When performing geographic operations, data often change class and sometimes loose their data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6.2 sf\n",
    "\n",
    "The *sf* package will generally operate faster and seamlessly within the tidyverse compared to the sp package, but is still in (rapid) development. Fortunately, it is very easy to move between sf and sp. You can read more about sf [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Know About sf:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* New in 2016 and growing rapidly\n",
    "* Regular data frames with an extra list-structured geometry column that are **not** SpatialData objects but are one of three nested main sf object classes (see below) represented by S3 datatypes\n",
    "* \"Language independent\" standard spatial data structure (ISO standard ISO 19125-1:2004: [https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html))\n",
    "* Follow tidy data rules and will not change class (though geometry can change) and retain their data\n",
    "* Tidyverse commands that work with sf objects: [https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/tidyverse.html](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/tidyverse.html)\n",
    "* Use spatial indexing, so many spatial query operations faster\n",
    "* Cannot be used in operations that require data of class SpatialData (i.e., sp objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sf objects are organized into three main classes, which you can read more about [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html). In most cases these classes are nested. That is, an sf object contains an sfc object which contains a sfg object (see full description below). It is possible to convert back and forth between these summary classes using functions like st_as_sf() and st_as_sfc(). I'll discuss this more in Sections 2.6 and 2.7. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Main sf Geometry Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, sf geometries are organized into three main classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. sf - the data frame that with feature attributes and feature geometries, this contains...\n",
    "2. sfc - the list-column with the geometries for each record, this contains...\n",
    "3. sfg - the feature geometry of an individual simple feature\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different types of \"simple features\" geometry types represented by the sf package (Table 1). You can read about all of these [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table 1. Geometries represented in the sf package. Source: https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html](img/sf_geometries.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6.3 stars\n",
    "\n",
    "The stars package is used for handling raster and vector data. Its name stands for \"spatio-temporal tidy arrays for R\". You can read more about stars [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two caveats here are that (1) stars is still being developed and (2) it is built to be used for multi-dimensional *vector and raster* data (e.g., a 10-year long time-series of rainfall grids for the USA) called \"arrays\" or \"data cubes\". There is also the raster package, which is used for raster data only, but it does not interface well with the tidyverse. You can read more about the raster package [here](https://github.com/rspatial/raster). The mapedit package might be of interest if you're looking to edit spatial data (e.g., snapping GPS points to streams or roads). For more info on mapedit go [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit). Check out the [rspatial GitHub page](https://github.com/r-spatial) for the latest updates on all these R packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7 What is a coordinate reference system (CRS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A coordinate reference systems defines how we convert (or we can say \"project\") a 3D object (in this case, the Earth) to 2D surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major types of projections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. cylindrical\n",
    "2. conical\n",
    "3. planar\n",
    "\n",
    "This image shows what I mean by \"project\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 2. Depiction of different spatial projections. Source: https://docs.qgis.org/](img/projections.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each projection type preserves unique spatial properties. You should choose the projection you use based on what spatial property (i.e., distance, area, angle) you want to preserve. For more on this see [here](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html#figure-projection-families).\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have also heard the word \"datum\". Some example datums include WGS84 or NAD83. A datum is the reference surface (usually an spheroid) that anchors a CRS. The WGS84 datum is a 3D reference surface (usually in latitude and longitude) while NAD83 is a 2D (projected) reference surface (usually in distance units like meters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 shows how a datum defines a spheroid that forms the reference surface for real-world spatial data. This data can then be projected onto a 2D surface (i.e., a map).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 3. Schematic of how we represent 3D information on a 2D surface. Source: https://gis.stackexchange.com/](img/datum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7.1 An !Important! Note About Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**R does not manage CRS \"on the fly\"**, so the onus is on you to manage the CRS (and extent, resolution, etc.) of your data. Many times this will mean that when attempting to work with two or more data (e.g., extract values to points from a set of shape files), you will get an error message that the data do not share projects and/or they do not align. Often you can also not get an error message but your data might not be showing up on your map correctly (e.g., spatial boundaries are not lining up).\n",
    "\n",
    "I find CRS management to be one of the time consuming parts of spatial data work in R. At the start of any spatial data project, you may wish to establish a set of reference data objects (e.g., snapshp.shp) to serve as a template for the official projection, extent, origin, resolution, etc.  When you import any data to R, you should always check if it matches snapshp.shp and, if not, proceed to reproject, crop, clip, resample, align…. Whatever steps are necessary to make it conform to the project template.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7.2 CRS Representation in sf\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to define a CRS in sf:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. proj4 string - a character string with CRS info\n",
    "2. EPSG code - a standard numeric code that defines a projection type\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as one of these is defined, you can move on. However, if you want to define both, that might prove less confusing to your future-self. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7.3 Coordinate Systems Websites\n",
    "\n",
    "Various websites provide free services to look-up CRS definitions, characteristics, and transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most provide one or more of the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* a short permanent link\n",
    "* opportunity to export CRS definition in various formats (WKT, XML, OGC GML, Proj.4, JavaScript, SQL)\n",
    "* a numeric reference code (i.e., EPSG code) that can be used in place of a fully specified CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggested websites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [https://epsg.io/](http://www.epsg-registry.org/) - open source nicer user interface to access data in the EPSG registry, includes a little transformation calculator too! and proj4 string generator, this is my go-to CRS look-up database\n",

    "3. [http://www.epsg-registry.org/](http://www.epsg-registry.org/) - official database, but ugly slow interface\n",

GAGES-II provides geospatial data and classifications of 9,322 stream gages that are maintained by the USGS. It includes: (1) watershed boundaries by region (spatial data), (2) USGS stream gage locations (spatial data), (3) watershed characteristics (tabular data).

    "### 5.1 Other Interesting Spatial Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "**ggsn package**\n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't played around with adding compass roses, scale bars, and all these other important map elements. While not reproducible (I admit!), I will typically export to PDF and then do my edits in Inkscape (think open-source Adobe Illustrator). If you're really wanting to do this in a reproducible way, looks like you can use the [ggsn package](http://oswaldosantos.github.io/ggsn/) in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "**raster package**\n",
    "\n",
    "I definitely recommend using the raster package if you have to do any raster spatial data analysis. However, be warned that this package is currently not very friendly with tidyverse packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**parallel and doParallel packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a big spatial dataset you might need to implement parallel computing. You can use these packages to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tmap package**\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is great package for making maps. I didn't have enough time to cover it but I recommend checking it out. More information [here](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap).\n",
    "\n",
    "**leaflet and mapview packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these packages to make your maps interactive. See more information about leaflet [here](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and about mapview [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/). Notably, the leaflet package only works with vector spatial data while mapview can be used for displaying both vector and raster data.\n",
