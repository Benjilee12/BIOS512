    "- data visualization\n",
    "  - sorting chart scales meaningfully\n",
    "  - selecting the appropriate `geom`\n",
    "  - encoding data with a number of chart properties (color, axes, size, etc.)\n",
    "  - adding multiple panels/facets\n",
    "  - annotating or otherwise labelling interesting values\n",
    "- data wrangling\n",
    "  - re-shaping data into `tidy` format\n",
    "  - filtering, grouping, extracting, joining, and aggregating raw data into a form suitable for vizualization\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Find a dataset\n",
    "  - Either download and add your dataset to your GitHub repository, or access it via a URL\n",
    "  - **Transform your data as needed and encode these steps in your Jupyter Notebook** (see below)\n",
    "1. Build a data narrative for your dataset in a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "  - The narrative should consist of **two or more paragraphs**\n",
    "  - Be concise -- you don't have to exhaustively describe your dataset\n",
    "    - pick a couple features of interest\n",
    "  - Include **two or more vizualizations**\n",
    "    - take care to **sort** your scales (e.g. the axes) meaningfully\n",
    "    - chart titles/labels should be understandable and legible\n",
    "    - annotate special features of interest (if applicable)\n",
    "    - use facets or multiple panels where appropriate"
